# take_home
## Description  
I was given **take-home_eval-data.xlsx**, an excel file containing 3 pages representing different parts of this assignment. Each page had a different prompt or set of questions I should answer. I utilized the Pandas library on this assignment, working betweeen the Jupyter Notebook and spreadsheets. I used spreadsheets for inputting notes, making minor edits, etc.

### Files
**Take_Home.ipynb** is the Jupyter Notebook I worked in, and contains all my documentation and analysis. **annotated_take-home_eval-data.xlsx** is the spreadsheet containing all the relevant notes or transforms in their final forms. The other .xlsx files represent various points of progress while working between Pandas a  

## Prompts
For Part 1, I created a document to visualize and answer questions about the query data I was given. In Part 2, I created a scoring rubric and reported information about the quality of keyword and article title mathes. In Part 3, I rated the quality of translated article titles and translated article body text.  
### Part 1: Query Annotation
Identify patterns in the data and create labels to group similar keywords.  
* Feel free to edit the spreadsheet as needed (re-sort, add columns etc.)  
* Summarize your findings. This should include  
  * a description of each group  
  * % of total keywords that each group contains  
  * any other notes/observations about the data or your methods for selecting the groups  

### Part 2: Result Quality Evaluation
Create a rubric to score the pairs of queries and article titles.  
Not all bad matches are created equally. Make sure that your rubric is granular enough to distinguish
between multiple levels of “bad”. Label the pairs according to your scoring rubric and summarize the
evaluation results.

### Part 3: Translation Evaluation
Rate the quality of the translations.  
### Japanese text translated to English
* Do the English translations capture the topic and user intent?  
### English text translated to Japanese  
* Are there grammatical errors? Would the Japanese translations seem awkward or otherwise not
make sense to a Japanese reader?

## Final Thoughts
I was really excited to work on this assignment. I particularly enjoyed Part 1, as I got to be creative and create a document that I was able to use to answer questions about the data set using Pandas. Learning how to use Pandas has been one of my main interests on my journey to learn more Python. This particular assignment stands out to me as a really fun and hueristic experience in that regard.  

The most important skill I utilized during the completion of this assignment was research. The solutions I used to solve the problems and questions contained in this assignemnt were not obvious to me. I probably spent more time on reading documentation than anything else.

I'm grateful to Sasha for putting this assignment together for me and the consideration of the team. I look forward to meeting you all.
