    "### Japanese → English ###\n",
    "In general, the translations were acceptable and if they retained their topic they also retained their user intent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**72.2%** of inputs **retained** their topic and user intent.  \n",
    "**27.8%** of inputs **did not retain** topic or user intent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the **27.8%** of inputs that **did not retain their topic or user intent**, there are 3 reasons why.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**40%** were affected by **polysemy**, the many possible meanings for a word or phrase.  \n",
    "**40%** were mistranslated **katakana words.**  \n",
    "**20%** were mistranslated due to **spacing.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Polysemy ###  \n",
    "At **index 17**, translating 'hp 法人 向け'(eichipi- houjinmuke) to 'For HP corporation' introduces ambiguity not present in the Japanese input. The original input expresses the user intent of somebody seeking to purchase HP laptops in bulk at a reduced price per unit as part of a B2B sale. This translation captures the 'for' from '向け' (muke) and '法人' (koujin) kind of blends with 'HP' to from 'HP corporations.' Spacing within the compound word '法人向け', likely exacerbates this problem.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At **index 12**, translating '募集 求人' to 'Recruitment' condenses both Japanese words into one English word. Semantic aspects of both words include the idea of recruitment, but the translated query 'Recruitment' does not capture the intent of looking for job postings. This was likely unaffected by spacing. Though these words are used in close proximity to each other, '募集求人' is not a compound word.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Katakana mistranslations ###\n",
    "At **index 5 and 9**, 'ローレックス' (ro-rekkusu) is mistranslated as 'lawx.' The correct translation should be Rolex, as in the luxury watch brand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Katakana is a Japanese writing system that is mostly used for foreign words. Katakana characters represent a sylabble comprised of a consonant and vowel pair. The mistranslation at **index 5 and 9** is unusual because the derivation of the character 'x' in 'lawx' suggests the algorith is breaking the katakana characters into smaller phonemes and excluding the /r/ sound to create 'lawx.' This is a somewhat sophisticated mistake. In the case of an insufficient corpus such that 'ローレックス' would not be translated to 'Rolex', a more expected mistranslation would be something like 'lawlex' or 'lawrex.' \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Spacing ###\n",
    "There are half-width spaces between and within words in every query on this list. These spaces can cause issues with machine translation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Seeing half-width spaces suggests that these are keywords suggested to a user by Google, rather than ones input entirely by the user. This is because Japanese uses full-width spaces and only between sentences or clauses. It's been [documented](https://www.humblebunny.com/multilingual-seo-japanese-research/) that when Google suggests keywords they insert these half-width spaces between *words.* A suggested keyword is functionally identical to the same query that is typed without half-width spaces, but insertion of these spaces often breaks up compound words and could lead to mistranlsations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At **index 4** for example, the suggested query [型 落ち デスクトップ パソコン](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%9E%8B+%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1+%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97+%E3%83%91%E3%82%BD%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3&rlz=1C1FKPE_enUS965US965&sxsrf=ALiCzsbe6s4Vuwf1QzbUuwWCvL0Msp1Xjw%3A1656985137306&ei=MZbDYuGrEsTa9AOM_YXACg&ved=0ahUKEwihiIfUzuD4AhVELX0KHYx-AagQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=%E5%9E%8B+%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1+%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97+%E3%83%91%E3%82%BD%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBAgjECc6BwgjEOoCECdKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQqQZYqQZgigloAXABeACAAT-IAT-SAQExmAEAoAEBoAECsAEKwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz) would return the same SERP as [型落ちデスクトップパソコン](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E5%9E%8B%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%91%E3%82%BD%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3&rlz=1C1FKPE_enUS965US965&sxsrf=ALiCzsYwss3acSViC2BP5n6GfJgytUZl0w%3A1656985726306&ei=fpjDYuehEvKG0PEPqsKU0AQ&ved=0ahUKEwjn2PTs0OD4AhVyAzQIHSohBUoQ4dUDCA8&uact=5&oq=%E5%9E%8B%E8%90%BD%E3%81%A1%E3%83%87%E3%82%B9%E3%82%AF%E3%83%88%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%83%91%E3%82%BD%E3%82%B3%E3%83%B3&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQgAEIAEOgcIIxDqAhAnSgQIQRgASgQIRhgAUNQBWNQBYOYJaAFwAXgAgAE8iAE8kgEBMZgBAKABAaABArABCsABAQ&sclient=gws-wiz), but in this case the suggested keyword was mistranslated due to the insertion of spaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions ##\n",
    "1. Polysemic mistranslations comprised **40%** of mistranslations and [could point to a low quality corpus in the MT system used.](https://sienstranslation.com/en/blog/2020/12/23/most-frequent-errors-in-machine-translation/)   \n",
    "2. Katakana mistranslations also comprised **40%** of mistranslations, although both examples were of the same word mistranslated the same way. The deconstruction of katakana syllables into smaller phonemes was sophisticated in a way, but I would not expect a MT system trained on sufficient corpora to fail to translate 'Rolex.'  \n",
    "3. Spacing affected all the queries, but only **20%** were mistranslated *wholly* because of the insertion of half-width spaces. I expect that mistranslation due to spacing would be mitigated to an extent by the ideographic meaning of Kanji, the system of Japanese writing using Chinese ideographic characters. \n",
    "\n",
    "If this data were representative of a larger data set, nearly 30% would be mistranslated. **This would make for a poor user experience and risks user retention.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Mistranslations could be reduced by:\n",
    "1. Improving or implementing [word sense disambiguation](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Word_sense_disambiguation) to reduce mistranslations due to polysemy. \n",
    "2. Accounting for how suggested keywords differ from user generated keywords in regard to spacing. "

Otherwise, you might want to consider taking a weekend off to make a foodie trip to Australia. The king oysters found in the south-central Coffin Bay are huge, succulent and intensely flavorful. If you’d like to make a day or an evening of it, you can even join one of the many Coffin Bay oyster tours and dine on some of the freshest, tastiest seafood in the world. Oh, and wine is often included.   \n",

    "I am not a native Japanese speaker, but there are no glaring grammatical errors that I can see in any of the translated Japanese. I believe that a Japanese reader would understand all of the translated article titles. However, some of the article text is awkward and may cause slight confusion.  \n",

    "The translated article titles are all grammatically correct and retain their meaning. There are some phrases that might be optimized for better search visibility.\n",
    "* For instance at **index 18**, 'ビーチの家' (bi-chi no ie) meaning beach house is a broad query and returns all sorts of phrases relating to beaches and houses. Something like '海沿いの家' (umizoi no ie) meaning seaside house returns real estate listings and articles similar to the orginal AMG Network article.\n",
    "* At **index 20**, 'ベッドシート' (beddo shi-to) might be improved by using a more common synonym 'ベッドシーツ' (beddo shi-tsu).\n",

    "The translated article text at **index 23** suffers mostly from **literal translation.** It also sounds a bit unnatural. \n",
    "* Repitition of the second person pronoun 'あなた' (anata) in the first 3 sentences in the example at index 23 sounds unnatural. In Japanaese it sounds more natural to omit the subject or topic of the sentence, only mentioning it if context would otherwise fail.  \n",
    "* 'Once in a blue moon' is translated literally and the idiomatic meaning is lost in translation.  \n",
    "* 'Pain' as in an annoyance is translated to '苦痛' (kutsuu) meaning anguish, which sounds bizzarely intense.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The input article text at **index 24** contains long and wordy clauses that form complex sentences. Even so, I believe this is the better translated of the two texts. The translated text suffers from **ambiguity** created by translating certain English prases containing 'oyster' into katakana.\n",
    "* The translation of 'king oyster' to 'キングオイス' (kingu oisuta-) never connects the katakana spelling of the Englsh word 'oyster' to the more common Japanese word for oyster, which is 'カキ' (kaki). I think that it's very likely that a Japanese reader would infer from the context that this article is written about oysters, but it's not stated explicitly in the translation.  \n",
    "* The translation of 'ああ' (aa) in this article may or may not convey the fun and informational tone of the input text. I don't often see 'ああ' (aa) in writing outside of dialog or personal correspondence. It could seem strange, but I can't say for sure. \n",

    "**The translated article titles are acceptable**. From an SEO standpoint, they could be improved by researching synonymous keywords in the target language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The translated article text is clearly machine translated. It sounds unnatural in places, and at times it doesn't make sense. **Were the translated article text to go live it could risk repelling a readership.**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing an editorial style guide to improve the performance of machine translation would be worth exploring. Utilizing controlled langauge has been instrumental in creating documentation, manuals, and various other technical information that is easily machine translatable. I wonder if this could be achieved editorially as well.  "

    "4). '型落ち' (kataochi) means out-of-production or an older model. This phrase was likely mistranslated due to spacing in the original query '型 落ち'. '型落ち\" (kataochi) is formed from the word '型' (kata) meaning type, form, or standard and '落ち' (ochi) the noun stem of the verb '落ちる' (ochiru) which means to fall or to drop.  \n",

The machine translation is still accuracte despite this due to the ideographic meaning of the character '付' which comes from the verb '付く' (tsuku) in this case.  \n",

    "12). The two words in this query are '募集' (boshuu) and '求人' (kyuujin). Both words refer to 'recruitment' of some kind. '募集' (boshuu) means recruitment by means of advertisement or solicitation, while '求人' (kyuujin) is a job listing. The translated query would return general informational content about recruitment, but not necessarily job listings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14). Translating the query '探偵 浮気 調査'(tantei uwagi chousa) to 'detective cheating survey' retains the topic. However, the user intent is ambiguous as 'survey' can be interpreted as a data aquisition method. It can also mean 'survey' as in an examination or investigation. The English keyword 'survey' returns articles about extramarital detective work _citing_ surveys higher on the SERP, where 'investigation' might return pricing information about extramarital detective services. This semantic ambiguity exists in the Japanese word '調査' (chousa) as well.  \n",

    "21). Though grammatically correct, this translated query didnt return precise results via the first SERP on Ask, Google, or Yahoo Japan. Precision was highest using Yahoo.com. \n",
    "\n",
    "23). The repetition of 'あなた' in the first three sentences sounds strange, as the syntactic subject or topic is often ommited. The idiomatic expression 'once in a blue moon' translates literally and won't make sense. 'Pain' gets translated literally as well and sounds intense, where 'inconvenient' may fit the tone better.\n",
